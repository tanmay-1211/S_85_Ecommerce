## Milestone 22: Address API Integration 🌐

✅ Backend Endpoint Implementation
- Created an API endpoint to receive the address from the frontend.
- Validated and stored the address in the `address` array inside the user collection.

✅ Database Integration
- Updated the user schema to ensure multiple addresses can be stored.
- Implemented authentication and error handling for secure address updates.

Now, users can add their address, and it will be stored successfully! 🚀
