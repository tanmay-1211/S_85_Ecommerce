Milestone 4 - User Model, Controllers & File Uploads
Introduction 🚀
Welcome to Milestone 4! In this milestone, we will focus on enhancing our backend by implementing a User Model, setting up controllers to handle user-related data, and enabling file uploads using Multer. By the end of this milestone, you will have a structured way to store user data, manage interactions, and support file uploads.

Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Create a User Model: Define the structure of user data in the database.
Create a User Controller: Manage user-related operations such as adding and retrieving user information.
Enable and Configure Multer: Implement file uploads to store user profile pictures or other files.
Update the README file: Document your progress effectively.
Key Concepts 📌
1. What’s a Model?
A model is like a blueprint that defines how data is stored in the database. In MongoDB, we use Schemas to structure our data.

Example: A User Model may include fields like name, email, and password.
This ensures consistency in how data is saved and retrieved.
2. What’s a Controller?
A controller is responsible for handling user interactions with the application. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the database.

Example: When a user signs up, the controller handles the request, processes the data, and saves it to the database.
Think of it as a manager that directs requests and responses efficiently.
3. File Uploads with Multer
Multer is a middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js applications.

It enables users to upload profile pictures or other documents.
It stores files in a designated folder and provides access to them when needed.
Steps to Complete Milestone 4 📝
This milestone includes the following steps:

Create the User Model

Define a schema for user data using Mongoose.
Ensure fields like name, email, password, and profilePicture are included.
Create the User Controller

Implement functions to handle user-related actions such as registering a user and retrieving user data.
Set Up Multer for File Uploads

Configure Multer to allow users to upload files.
Store uploaded files in a designated folder.
Update the README File

Document the new changes made in this milestone.
Provide clear instructions on how to use the new features.
Submission Guidelines 📥
To complete this milestone, follow these submission steps:

✅ Push your code to the same GitHub repository used for previous milestones. ✅ Ensure your repository is publicly accessible. ✅ Update your README file with a section summarizing Milestone 4. ✅ Submit your repository link as per the assignment requirements.

Next Steps 🚀
In the next milestone, we will introduce more advanced features to enhance your app! Keep up the great work, and feel free to reach out for help if needed.
