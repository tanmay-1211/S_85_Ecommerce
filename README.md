E-Commerce Follow Along: Key Takeaways Project Goals Build a full-fledged e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Gain hands-on experience in real-world full-stack development.

Learning Outcomes Understand the structure of a MERN stack project. Set up project repositories and foundational tools. Master core functionalities: User authentication. Product and order management. Database schema design. Core Concepts REST API Design: Create endpoints for users, products, and orders. MongoDB Schema: Design meaningful and structured data models. Authentication: Implement secure login and registration systems. Backend Development: Use Node.js and Express for robust server-side APIs.

Milestones Overview

Project Overview Introduction to the MERN stack. Live demo of the final e-commerce application. Set up a GitHub repository with a README summarizing Milestone 1.
Development Environment Setup Install tools: Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and VS Code. Initialize the project with npm init and install dependencies (e.g., express, mongoose, dotenv).
Backend Development Create REST APIs for: User Authentication (Register/Login). Product Management (Add, update, delete, and retrieve products). Order Handling (Manage orders and transactions). Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders. Implement middleware for validation and error handling.
Frontend Development Set up the React project with create-react-app or Vite. Build key UI components: User Pages (Login, Registration, Profile). Product Pages (Listing, Search, Details). Order Pages (Cart, Checkout, Order History). Use React Router for navigation and manage state with Redux or Context API.
Integration, Testing, and Deployment Integrate the frontend and backend using API calls. Test functionality and resolve bugs with tools like Postman.
Deploy: Backend using Heroku, Render, or AWS. Frontend using Netlify or Vercel. Ensure the application is secure and production-ready. Final Deliverable A complete MERN-based e-commerce application featuring: Secure authentication. Product and order management. A responsive and user-friendly interface. Fully tested and deployed online.
