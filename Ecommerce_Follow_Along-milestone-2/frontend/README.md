# Ecommerce_Follow_Along


E-Commerce Follow Along: Key Takeaways Project Goals Build a full-fledged e-commerce application using the MERN stack. Gain hands-on experience in real-world full-stack development.

Learning Outcomes Understand the structure of a MERN stack project. Set up project repositories and foundational tools. Master core functionalities: User authentication. Product and order management. Database schema design. Core Concepts REST API Design: Create endpoints for users, products, and orders. MongoDB Schema: Design meaningful and structured data models. Authentication: Implement secure login and registration systems. Backend Development: Use Node.js and Express for robust server-side APIs.

Milestones Overview

Project Overview Introduction to the MERN stack. Live demo of the final e-commerce application. Set up a GitHub repository with a README summarizing Milestone 1.
Development Environment Setup Install tools: Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and VS Code. Initialize the project with npm init and install dependencies (e.g., express, mongoose, dotenv).
Backend Development Create REST APIs for: User Authentication (Register/Login). Product Management (Add, update, delete, and retrieve products). Order Handling (Manage orders and transactions). Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders. Implement middleware for validation and error handling.
Frontend Development Set up the React project with create-react-app or Vite. Build key UI components: User Pages (Login, Registration, Profile). Product Pages (Listing, Search, Details). Order Pages (Cart, Checkout, Order History). Use React Router for navigation and manage state with Redux or Context API.
Integration, Testing, and Deployment Integrate the frontend and backend using API calls. Test functionality and resolve bugs with tools like Postman.
Deploy: Backend using Heroku, Render, or AWS. Frontend using Netlify or Vercel. Ensure the application is secure and production-ready. Final Deliverable A complete MERN-based e-commerce application featuring: Secure authentication. Product and order management. A responsive and user-friendly interface. Fully tested and deployed online.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
